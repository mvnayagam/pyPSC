# pyPSC: Parameter Space Concept for Determining 1D-Projected Crystal Structures

**pyPSC** is a Python package that implements the Parameter Space Concept (PSC) for determining 1-dimensionally projected structures of independent scatterers from diffraction data. This method avoids traditional Fourier inversion and focuses on exploring all possible structural parameter combinations consistent with available diffraction data in a parameter space of dimension `m`.

## Features

- **No Fourier Inversion Required**: Instead of relying on Fourier sums, pyPSC leverages structure factor amplitudes or intensities, represented by piece-wise analytic hyper-surfaces.
- **Isosurface Intersection**: The method obtains the coordinates of scatterers by intersecting multiple isosurfaces, allowing for the detection of all possible solutions in a single derivation.
- **Resonant Contrast**: The spatial resolution achieved may exceed traditional Fourier inversion methods, especially when resonant contrast is considered.
- **Symmetry Optimizations**: Exploits symmetry properties of isosurfaces to optimize algorithms.
- **Monte-Carlo Simulations**: Includes simulations using projections of random two- and three-atom structures to illustrate the universal applicability of the method.
- **1D Projection Efficiency**: The PSC linearization approach is more efficient than Fourier sums, working with fewer reflections.

## Installation

You can install `pyPSC` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mvnayagam/pyPSC.git
```

## Usage

To start using `pyPSC`, you can import the necessary modules and run calculations on crystal structures based on diffraction data. Below is a simple example of how you might use the library:

```python
import pyPSC

# Load diffraction data and initialize parameter space
diffraction_data = pyPSC.load_data('data.hkl')

# Run the PSC algorithm to find possible structures
solutions = pyPSC.find_structures(diffraction_data)

# Output the solutions
for solution in solutions:
    print(solution)
```

## Methodology

### Parameter Space Concept (PSC)
The PSC method utilizes structure factor amplitudes or intensities as hyper-surfaces that define acceptable regions in parameter space. By intersecting these isosurfaces, the coordinates of scatterers are determined. This enables the detection of all possible solutions consistent with the given diffraction data.

### Key Advantages:
- Detects all possible solutions from the given structure factor amplitudes.
- Potentially surpasses the spatial resolution of Fourier inversion methods.
- Exploits symmetry properties of isosurfaces for optimized computations.

### Monte-Carlo Simulations
The algorithm has been tested with Monte-Carlo simulations, illustrating its efficacy in predicting structures of random two- and three-atom models.

## Examples

### Example 1: Two-Atom Structure
```python
from pyPSC import simulate

# Simulate a two-atom structure and project to 1D
structure = simulate.two_atom_structure()
projection = pyPSC.project_to_1D(structure)
print(projection)
```

### Example 2: Three-Atom Structure
```python
from pyPSC import simulate

# Simulate a three-atom structure and project to 1D
structure = simulate.three_atom_structure()
projection = pyPSC.project_to_1D(structure)
print(projection)
```
