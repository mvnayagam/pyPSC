# What is in the notebook?

This example provide a jupyter notebook to explain how to work out the structure determination using PSC implementation under `EPA` framework in two-dimensional PS. In 2D-PS, there are two methods are available to treat the intensity, these are 1. Single-segment and 2. Double-segment linearization.

In the given jupyter notebook you can find both the methods.

- NOTE: To increase the reflection order in the calculation, change the variable `h` accordingly.


In the cells required modules are imported and subsequently the PSC process is carried out in further cells.

The cells are titled and are self enplaned. In this notebook,

```py
coordinate = np.array([0.349, 0.362 ])
```

is taken as an example. 

**The notebook can be used only for PS of dimension of 2.**
