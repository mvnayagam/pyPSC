1. What is in the notebook?
    \
    This example provide a jupyter notebook to explain how to work out the structure determination using PSC implementation under `EPA + intensity` framework.


    In the cells required modules are imported and subsequently the PSC process is carried out in further cells.

    The cells are titled and are self enplaned. In this notebook,

    ```py
    coordinate = np.array([0.349, 0.362, 0.1615, 0.1615])
    ```
    
    is taken as an example. 

    The notebook can be used for any dimension from 3. 

2. ``EPA + Amplitude``
    \
    To run ``EPA+Amplitude`` framework, change the variable **``IorG``** in the cell ***Linearization*** to ``amplitude``. NOTE the key word should in small letters.
